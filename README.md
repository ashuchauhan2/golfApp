# golfApp

Simple golf app aimed at helping golfers practise more effectively through simulating real golf shots on driving range sessions.

The user will select start, then will be shown a series of images of golf shots.

They can then hit the golf shot appropriate to the image shown, and make personal notes of what they are doing well and not so well.

New images will be shown until user selects end or there are no images left, at which point the user can restart.
