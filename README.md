# golfApp

Simple golf app aimed at helping golfers practise more effectively through simulating real golf shots on driving range sessions.

The user will select start, then will be shown a series of images of golf shots.

They can then hit the golf shot appropriate to the image shown, and make personal notes of what they are doing well and not so well.

This is geared towards helping users find their strengths in their game, and weaknesses as they can be creative with distances they want to chose.
